            PULL REQUESTS: 

            1.) Before making any changes to this document, each partner should 'checkout' into their own branch in Terminal/Gitbash. To create the branch, type "git branch <branch name>". To checkout to the branch, type "git checkout <branch name>". You should notice that the word [master] in Terminal/Gitbash has changed to [<branch name>].
            
            2.) Add each partner's name to one of the stubs provided below.

            3.) Each partner should make changes to their own card (for now, just add some lorem ipsum to your card). Make sure that you do not make any changes outside of your own stub.

               Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolorum ipsum quo voluptatum illum vel libero, dicta cupiditate quos impedit maxime soluta ratione commodi corrupti? Obcaecati sit maxime beatae adipisci dolorum.

            4.) Each partner should commit the changes made to their own branch. Use the following commands:
               - git add .
               - git commit -m "<comment about changes being committed>"
               - git push origin <branch name> (not origin master!)

            5.) Each partner should go to the Github repository and submit a pull request.

            6.) Each partner should review and approve their partner's pull request. This will take the changes you made on your branch and merge them with the master branch.

            7.) Each partner should use "git pull origin master" in Terminal/Gitbash (use this command in your own branch). If you look at your partner's stub, you should see that the changes they made on their branch have been added to your HTML file.
